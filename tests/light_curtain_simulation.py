Preconditions: 
    - Components (button, light curtain, e-ink display, keyboard) must be connected to and detected by the Raspberry Pi
Postconditions: 
    - None
Side Effects: 
    - The ballot count will be updated when space bar is pressed on keyboard
    - The ballot count will be reset to 0 when the button is pressed
    - The E-ink display will update to reflect changes in the ballot count
Invariants: 
    - The ballot count will never be negative
